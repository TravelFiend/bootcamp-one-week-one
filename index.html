                <p>I was born in Cleveland, Ohio and this is where I spent most of my life. I have a bachelor's degree
                    in printmaking from Ohio University and shortly after graduating moved to Denver, Colorado. I had been
                    working in logistics for about 12 years when I realized that career path would not make me happy. I
                    needed to clear my head. I ultimately quit my job and toured across eastern and central Europe on a
                    bicycle, searching for some direction in life. It was on this trip that I first started dabbling in
                    code. After learning more and more I finally knew what I would like to pursue. Today, I am a member
                    of Alchemy Code Lab's 2019 fall cohort in Portland, Oregon.</p>

                    <p>For me, traveling is everything. Leaving my comfort zone and going to new places to meet new
                        people without the ability to communicate with words leaves me with no option but to overcome
                        obstacles without the resources I have grown accustomed to. When these issues arise, there is no better
                        feeling than proving to myself that I am able to succeed in a foreign setting. Relative to the number of
                        countries in the world, my list of visited countries is still pretty small, leaving me with a wide open road
                        ahead.</p>

                    <p>Cycling is another aspect of my life that I couldn't live without. Not too long ago, I cycled
                        through the majority of the countries listed above. This was my first big tour and I've never
                        felt so at peace than during that trip. Amid the journey, I was presented with amazing opportunities that
                        have positively impacted me and changed my character from the core. I had worked at a farm in
                        Germany where I not only fed the animals, but also learned how to skin and gut mammals. I also helped a
                        Croatian family maintain their olive garden. The fresh fish they cooked for me was some of the
                        best I've tasted. By far my favorite type of cycling is downhill. I first tried downhill at
                        Winter Park resort in Colorado, and haven't been able to look back.</p>
